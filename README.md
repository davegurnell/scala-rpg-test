Scalaquest: sandbox using Scala and Browserquest
================================================

Dave Gurnell, July 2012

A sandbox project for playing with [Scala] and the graphics from [Browserquest].

My intentions for this code, depending on how things go, are:

 - play with emergent behaviour and celular automata;
 - write a sequence of interesting Scala tutorials;
 - write an awesome game and make my millions (ha ha).

[Scala]: http://www.scala-lang.org
[Browserquest]: http://browserquest.mozilla.org/
